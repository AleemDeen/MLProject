Machine Learning Project: House Price Prediction

Overview This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on a dataset containing multiple variables related to properties and their surroundings. The goal is to create a reliable model that can estimate the market value of houses given specific features.

Key Features

Dataset: Contains thousands of entries with up to 4,000 variables, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.
Machine Learning Models: Various models were implemented, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to determine the best fit for the dataset.
Performance Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Installation To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required packages using pip:

git clone [repository URL] cd [project directory] pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage Run the main script to train the model and make predictions:

python main.py
